      Thanks to a grant from the NZART Radioscience Education Trust
      <strong>Dr Johan Potgieter</strong> launched the ADAC Science
      Experiment project with five students from the School of Engineering and
      Advanced Technology on the Albany Campus of Massey University.

    The Science ADAC (Attitude Determination And Control) package to be
    carried by KiwiSAT was significantly enhanced and advanced by
    additional support from Massey University.

    Five students from the School of Engineering and Advanced Technology on
    the Albany Campus - under the supervision of Lecturer in Robotics, Dr
    Johan Potgieter - worked with the KiwiSAT team towards the goal
    of orbital experimentation and research.

    Masters student Kirill Makarov and 4th Year Degree students
    Travers Biddle, Utsav Patel, Thomas Poupouara and Andrew Webb were
    part of the Massey ADAC team.

    Kirill teamed up with Dr Jon Henderson on the flight dynamics aspects
    whilst the sensor package was integrated, tested and calibrated by
    Travers, Utsav, Thomas and Andrew.

    The University's support was a huge boost for the international KiwiSAT
    project. AMSAT-ZL looks forward to continued co-operation with Massey
    University and trust a variety of challenging and satisfying projects
    may follow on for both the students and the University.
  </p>
  <p>
    Being an ongoing orbital experiment, much of the work cannot be
    implemented or verified until KiwiSAT is launched and has settled down in
    orbit. That event is eagerly anticipated.
