  <h2> Sun Sensor </h2>
  <p>
    It is intended to install two Sun Sensors with the Main Sun Sensor on an X
    or Y axis face of the ‘attic’ and a second, a Target Sun Sensor, on the Z-
    face of the satellite which forms the bottom (launch mounting) face.
  </p>
  <p>
    The two Sun Sensors are based on Hamamatsu Two Dimensional Position
    Sensitive Detector (PSD) Photo-diodes Type S 5991-01.

  <p>
    Each sensor has a pinhole aperture positioned centrally above a 9mm square
    photosensitive surface which outputs voltages proportional to the X/Y
    co-ordinates of a light spot which impinges on its surface. By suitably
    sizing the gap between the pinhole and the photosensitive surface, the
    range of angular readings can be set to suit the usage requirement. It is
    currently proposed that both sensors for KiwiSAT will be set to plus/minus
    45 degrees ‘around the clock’.

  <p>
    The analogue outputs from the sensors are digitized using computational
    and A/D chips. These will be read and stored - along with a time mark
    provided by the system clock. In addition to its angular reading, a 3
    state output validation signal will also be transferred via the telemetry
    stream to indicate the following states; “Sensor OFF”, “Detector Current
    out of Range” and “Signal Valid”. The sun sensors will be ground
    switch-able via either uplink.

    Prototype - Test Rig

  <p>
    A trial head was built and this, in conjunction with a spare electronic
    system PCB - donated by AMSAT-NA (our thanks to them) - was used for
    system testing/proving. The trials, using the ex AO-40 board were
    completed satisfactorily and changes that were appropriate to the use of
    the above mentioned improved tetra-lateral PSD were made prior to the
    production of a custom prototype PCB. This was populated and fully proven
    using the prototype detector head.

    During the trial it became clear that the head could be considerably
    reduced in size and a Mk2 – with a 50% saving in weight - was drawn up and
    two pieces were produced. The system has been tested over a period of two
    years and has been provisionally accepted. New PCB’s are being produced
    using SMT components. These will be assembled to flight standard and fully
    tested in the thermal vacuum test facility prior to final acceptance for
    flight.
