<h2>KiwiSAT will not fly.</h2>
<p>At its 2023 Annual General Meeting AMSAT-ZL unanimously voted
  to dissolve. We do not have the manpower, finances, or interest
  to conduct a successful launch campaign to get KiwiSAT to orbit.</p>
<p>The group is looking for a site where the satellite can be displayed.</p>

<h2>KiwiSAT. All systems are now fight ready. </h2>
<h3>Outstanding:</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Final integration</strong> - All hardware is complete and KiwiSAT
  is operational. Final integration to launch ready awaits addition of the
  flight batteries and fragile solar cells.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Launch negotiation</strong> - AMSAT-ZL are in discussion with
  several agencies. Funding is an important aspect as costs increase and
  resources are stretched.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Flight Software</strong> - Software is developing on three fronts:
</p>
<ol class="pl-6 list-disc">
  <li>
      <u>Boot loader/Operating System</u>   <br />
      Clayton (ZL3TKA), well aided by a VNC connection between his QTH (in
      Canberra) and the clean area then in Massey University in Albany on
      the Auckland North Shore (<em>See image</em>), developed and wrote the
      boot loader. A period of
      intensive reliability testing has proved the reliability of this
      important link in KiwiSAT control.

        {% image "src/img/clean_room-2011.jpg", "KiwiSAT in final assembled format under test in the AMSAT-ZL Clean Room at Massey University in Albany", "300" %}
        AMSAT-ZL Clean Room
      </div>
    <p>
      Two ROM development chips contain the code in flash form in sockets on
      the IHU Main Board. This will then be burnt onto non volatile memory
      IC’s and permanently mounted for flight operation. Pre-flight testing
      and calibration continue.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <u>ADAC Application Software</u>
      <br />
      Whilst not absolutely essential pre-launch, it is considered highly
      desirable to complete the (non-ADAC) operational software whilst the
      satellite is in the clean area and a small team have expressed an
      interest in a coordinated approach to this activity.   Clayton will
      take the lead and when at least a basic (but totally reliable!)
      command system is proven, the launch sponsorship campaign will be
      ramped up to full gear.
      <br />
      AMSAT-ZL volunteer Dr Jon Henderson provided an active supervisory
      role on Massey University Masters student Kirill Makarov for this
      activity and progress is now excellent in this area. The NZART
      Radioscience Education Trust sponsored Kirill who breathed some
      greatly appreciated extra enthusiasm into the project. (See ADAC
      Status section for details)
  </li>
  <li>
      <u>Ground Station Telemetry Decode Program</u>
      <br />
      Terry (ZL2BAC) took on the development of the ground-station telemetry
      decode software and great progress has been made. The Telemetry update
      posted on this site provides the basic information and Terry is happy
      to communicate directly with those having particular interest in this
      aspect. See <a href="telemetry">Telemetry page</a> for more
      details.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  <strong>Regulatory requirements</strong> - KiwiSAT is registered with the
  ITU in preparation for launch.
</p>
<h2>The Structure</h2>
<p>From the bottom of KiwiSAT and working up.</p>
<h3>Tray No 1</h3>
<div>
  {% image "src/img/Dec_09/Tray_3.jpg", "Transmitters installed in bottom tray", "300" %}
  Transmitter Tray
</div>
<p>
  The Transmitter tray is completed to Flight Ready status. Now integrated
  into final assembly. System meets all expectations.
</p>
<h3>Tray No 2.</h3>
<div>
  {% image "src/img/Dec_09/BCR_Tray.jpg", "Battery Charge Regulator - this unit controls all on-board DC power, supplying discrete voltages to each module", "300" %}
  Central Power Control
</div>
<p>
  The BCR (Battery Charge Regulator) is completed and integrated into final
  assembly system. Currently active in controlling power from Solar cell
  simulators to the fully integrated KiwiSAT unit.
</p>
<h3>Tray No 3. </h3>
<div>
  {% image "src/img/Dec_09/Bat_Tray.jpg", "Battery tray", "300" %}
  System Battery
</div>
<p>
  The battery tray. While this tray is completed and ready for flight. A
  spare set of batteries are being used during the bench testing.
</p>
<h3>Tray No 4.</h3>
<div>
  {% image "src/img/Dec_09/IHU_Tray.jpg", "Central control and command computer", "300" %}
  IHU
</div>
<p>
  <u>The IHU and RAM disk</u>
  <br />
  The IHU <em>(or Integrated Housekeeping Unit)</em> is the essential
  central satellite system control computer.
</p>
<p>
  This unit is completed and integrated into the final assembly.
</p>
<h3>Tray No 5 -The receivers. </h3>
<div>
  {% image "src/img/Dec_09/Rx_Tray.jpg", "Receiver tray - placed close to receive arials", "300" %}
  Receiver Tray
</div>
<p>
  This completed tray holds the 70cm linear transponder receiver and two
  70cm FM receivers, one for the FM transponder, the other a telemetry
  receiver for control and command.
</p>
<p>
  This completed system is integrated into the final assembly unit and
  running &quot;on-air&quot; using external antenna while KiwiSAT sits in
  its clean environment chamber at ponga Road.
</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>The Attic. </h3>
<div>
  {% image "src/img/Dec_09/Flatsat_4.jpg", "Top Tray or Attic containing the sensors, attitude detectors and Receive Antenna arrays etc..", "300" %}
  Science Attic
</div>
<p>Completed and integrated into the final assembly unit.</p>
<h3>Looming Up</h3>
<div>
  {% image "src/img/Flight_loom_1.jpg", "Development too for the important inter-tray connection loom", "300" %}
  Completed Flight Loom
</div>
<p>
  Wiring of the frame, part of the final integration, was completed early
  and now forms part of the fully integrated KiwiSAT.
</p>
<h2 class="pt-12">Ground Testing</h2>
<div>
  {% image "src/img/technical/Massey_2.jpg", "Test antennas mounted external to the Clean Room building for early proving trials", "300" %}
  Test Antenna
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  KiwiSAT, in its flight configuration, is in the AMSAT-ZL clean environment
  chamber at Ponga Road. A remote antenna system allows live testing via the
  flight mode.
</p>
<p>
  Auckland is reasonably hilly and with the team spread over a wide area,
  these good antenna are required to guarantee reliable communications.
</p>
<h2 class="pt-12">Solar Panels</h2>
<div>
  {% image "src/img/Solar_panels_1.jpg", "Solar panel set ready for final assembly on the face sides of KiwiSAT", "300" %}
  Flight-ready Solar Panels
</div>
<p>
  The six flight solar panels are now assembled and tested awaiting final
  integration. Note the featured picture shows two of the four side panels
  plus the top and bottom (+Z/-Z) panels, there being the fewest panels on
  the bottom panel.
</p>
<h2 class="pt-12">AMSAT-ZL Clean Box</h2>
<div>
  {% image "src/img/Clean_cabinet.jpg", "Clean cabinet designed for KiwiSAT storage, transportation, demonstration, and on-going pre-launch testing", "300" %}
  KiwiSAT Clean Box!
</div>
<p>
  With the construction project now complete and with testing well advanced,
  the need for a Clean Room has passed. KiwiSAT is now housed in its own
  Clean Box. This allows for safe transportation, continued testing, and
  easy demonstration to our important launch sponsors.
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    AMSAT-ZL appreciate the professional assistance of the Fan and Filter
    suppliers in the development of the Clean Room at Massey University and
    the AMSAT-ZL Clean Box.
