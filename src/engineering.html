  <h2>Design Engineering and Construction </h2>
  <p>
    The design of KiwiSAT is based on the Microsat formula and is basically a
    system of trays clamped together in a box shape. Solar Cells cover the
    exterior to charge the batteries which are the prime power source for all
    on-board systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Various antenna are mounted on the top and bottom of the satellite in such
    a way as to give an excellent radiation pattern thus reducing signal
    strength variations common in many small satellites.
  </p>
  <p>
    The satellite systems have been broken down into: Linear Transponder, FM
    Transponder and Command System, Power Supply, On-board Computer
    (Integrated Housekeeping Unit - IHU), Science Package and Structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Separate teams have developed each part, yet maintained close contact.
  </p>
  <p>
    The satellite structure and hardware is effectively complete through to
    flight status. Work is now centred on software development - both flight
    and ground station - on the completion of which minor LV integration
    adjustments may be necessary prior to launch.
  </p>
  <p>
    The antenna configuration developed for best performance limits the choice
    of launch vehicles due to final release requirements. This does not
    significantly limit the launch opportunities neither does it limit the
    choice of a suitable orbit. (<a href="/media/fred_dec06.html">Video</a>)

  <p>
    Sub-assemblies have been assembled in various centres throughout New
    Zealand making this a truly nation-wide project.

    Fred Kennedy, ZL1BYP, in his role as lead engineer, has contributed
    significantly to the development and construction of KiwiSAT. Importantly,
    Fred's prior experience in the satellite field, through contributions to
    AO-40 and similar international projects, has proved invaluable. Fred
    continues his dedication to the project.
