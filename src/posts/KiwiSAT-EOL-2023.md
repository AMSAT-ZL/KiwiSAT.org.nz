At the AMSAT-ZL Annual General Meeting held at the NZART
Conference 2023, the group unanimously voted to dissolve
the organization.

There is hope that KiwiSAT can find a home at the Space
Museum at Te Awamutu or possibly one of the univeristies
that contributed to its design and construction.

[Documentation has been published](https://github.com/AMSAT-ZL)
in the hope that this open source work will benefit future
satellite efforts.

The remaining funds in the AMSAT-ZL treasury will be
donated to the NZART Radio Science Trust.
