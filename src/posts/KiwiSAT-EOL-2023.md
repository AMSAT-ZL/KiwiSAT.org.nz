At the [AMSAT-ZL Annual General Meeting](/papers/AMSAT-ZL-AGM-2023.pdf)
held at the NZART Conference 2023, the group unanimously voted to dissolve
the organization.

The KiwiSAT project started in 1999, and was practially
completed in 2010.  Lack of suitable launches and funds
for the final integration were unavailable, and the
project stalled.

There is hope that KiwiSAT can find a home at the Space
Museum at Te Awamutu or possibly one of the universities
that contributed to its design and construction.

[Documentation is published](https://github.com/AMSAT-ZL)
in the hope that this open source work will benefit future
satellite efforts.

The remaining funds in the AMSAT-ZL treasury will be
donated to the [NZART Radio Science Trust](https://www.nzart.org.nz/nzart/trust).
