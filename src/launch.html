    Early planning pointed towards ISC Kosmatras for a DNEPR launch in mid to
    late 2012. That time has passed and ride costs have escalated. More
    recently consideration has been given to a Great Wall of China launch
    opportunity.

  <p>
    The prospect of an all New Zealand operation with Rocket Lab is now a
    tempting option making for a true South Pacific effort.

    KiwiSAT has been teetering on the brink of launch for far too long.
    Resources have been committed to the two engineering items, solar cell
    mounting and assembly of a new flight battery pack.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Team won't say &quot;By Christmas&quot; as there's still work to do.
    That Flight Battery Pack will take almost 5 months to create, every cell
    must be individually tested for compatibility to ensure longest life of
    the whole pack thus maximising useful life in orbit.
