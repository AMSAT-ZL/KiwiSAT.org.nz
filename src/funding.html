    This project was funded by radio amateurs through personal and club
    donations, and by membership of AMSAT-ZL.

    It is pleasing to see the &quot;Kiwi Ingenuity&quot; achieving so much
    from what, in space project terms, is so little.

  <h3>30 August 2016 </h3>
  <p>
    It is pleasing to report that with the generosity of so may groups and
    individuals both in New Zealand and around the world we have been able to
    complete the development and construction to flight-ready operational
    status.
    <em>
      (See <a href="/status">Status</a>)
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Outstanding are final integration, vacuum chamber testing
    <em>(unfortunately not available in Auckland)</em>, software development,
    registration and launch. It is currently anticipated that suitable vacuum
    chambers will be available in Christchurch. This will mean some additional
    travel cost as transporting the integrated structure is a significant
    expense either in the purchase of a seat and/or an expensive freight box.
  </p>
  <p>
    To date the project has cost approximately NZ$45,000 with all hardware
    required to complete KiwiSAT in hand. Ahead of us is the relatively huge
    cost of the launch which involves not just the cost of the launch itself
    but the necessary support and required travel.
  </p>
  <p>
    AMSAT-ZL is confident that a sponsor can be found who will ensure our
    KiwiSAT flies.

  <h3>Solar Cell Special Funding</h3>
  <p>
    With the original target of NZ$35,000 in mind, AMSAT-ZL looked for a major
    sponsor and found one in the Wellington VHF Group. A unsolicited
    contribution of NZ$10,000 was presented to AMSAT-ZL exclusively to provide
    for the necessary Solar cells.

    <i>Hands of support - $10,000</i>
  </div>
  <p>
    At the 2007 Easter VHF Convention, Wellington VHF Group Secretary, Dick
    Greenbank, ZL2TGQ, presented a cheque for $10,000 to AMZAT-ZL. In response
    AMSAT-ZL set up a dedicated Solar cell procurement fund.
  </p>
  <p>
    In true spirit of cooperation, suitable cells were located and purchased
    at a considerable saving. As the purchase price and attachment costs were
    well short of this amount, AMSAT-ZL was legally bound to return the unused
    portion of the donation. In a magnanimous gesture The Wellington VHF Group
    in turn made a further generous donation to KiwiSAT.
