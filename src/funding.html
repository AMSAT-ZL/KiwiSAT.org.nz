<h1>Project Funding </h1>
<p>
    <strong>AMSAT-ZL</strong> gratefully acknowledges the
    <a href="/sponsors">many sponsors</a> who
    have assisted with services or hardware.
</p>
<p>
  This project was funded by radio amateurs through personal and club
  donations, and by membership of AMSAT-ZL.
</p>
<p>
  It is pleasing to see the &quot;Kiwi Ingenuity&quot; achieving so much
  from what, in space project terms, is so little.
</p>
<h3>30 August 2016 </h3>
<p>
  It is pleasing to report that with the generosity of so many groups and
  individuals both in New Zealand and around the world we have been able to
  complete the development and construction to flight-ready operational
  status.
  <em>
    (See <a href="/status">Status</a>)
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Outstanding are final integration, vacuum chamber testing
  <em>(unfortunately not available in Auckland)</em>, software development,
  registration, and launch. It is currently anticipated that suitable vacuum
  chambers will be available in Christchurch. This will mean some additional
  travel cost as transporting the integrated structure is a significant
  expense either in the purchase of a seat and/or an expensive freight box.
</p>
<p>
  To date the project has cost approximately NZ$45,000 with all hardware
  required to complete KiwiSAT in hand. Ahead of us is the relatively huge
  cost of the launch which involves not just the cost of the launch itself
  but the necessary support and required travel.
</p>
<p>
  AMSAT-ZL is confident that a sponsor can be found who will ensure our
  KiwiSAT flies.
</p>
<h3>Solar Cell Special Funding</h3>
<p>
  With the original target of NZ$35,000 in mind, AMSAT-ZL looked for a major
  sponsor and found one in the Wellington VHF Group. A unsolicited
  contribution of NZ$10,000 was presented to AMSAT-ZL exclusively to provide
  for the necessary Solar cells.

  <i>Hands of support - $10,000</i>
</div>
<p>
  At the 2007 Easter VHF Convention, Wellington VHF Group Secretary, Dick
  Greenbank, ZL2TGQ, presented a cheque for $10,000 to AMZAT-ZL. In response
  AMSAT-ZL set up a dedicated Solar cell procurement fund.
</p>
<p>
  In true spirit of cooperation, suitable cells were located and purchased
  at a considerable saving. As the purchase price and attachment costs were
  well short of this amount, AMSAT-ZL was legally bound to return the unused
  portion of the donation. In a magnanimous gesture The Wellington VHF Group
  in turn made a further generous donation to KiwiSAT.
