  <h1>An Amateur Radio Contribution to Climate Change Research</h1>
  <h2>KiwiSAT Ionospheric Research Project </h2>

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Various satellite companies are investigating the use of satellite borne
    radar systems to track such climate change parameters as Biomass
    assessment, Forest inundation, Ice sheet thickness measurement and
    subsurface moisture levels.
  </p>
  <p>
    The most suitable frequencies for these radar systems are in the 400MHz
    region.
  </p>
  <p>
    Improving the measurement accuracy requires a thorough understanding of
    the characteristics of the applicable portion of the ionosphere at these
    frequencies. Currently few satellites carry transmitters producing
    suitable signals for this research, and even fewer that are in suitable
    orbits.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ionospheric characteristics that require investigation are Total
    Electron Content (TEC) and Faraday Rotation.

  <p>
    During the construction phase of KiwiSAT the engineering team was
    approached by EADS Astrium<sup>*</sup> on behalf of Professor Cathryn Mitchell,
    University of Bath, seeking inclusion of a special beacon to provide a
    compatible signal for this ionospheric research. A 470MHz phase-coherent
    beacon was quickly designed and integrated into KiwiSAT to accommodate
    this request.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Dual Beacon Experiment</h3>

  <p>
    To investigate these signal path characteristics, KiwiSAT will transmit
    two identical, phase locked, signals, one at 145.865 MHz with 1 Watt EIRP
    via an omni-directional circularly polarised antenna, the other on 437.425
    MHz at 100 mW (+20 dBm). This 437 MHz signal is linear polarised via a
    quarter-wave whip antenna on the -Z face of the spacecraft. Both channels
    will carry telemetry at 9600 bps using the International Amateur Radio
    standard AFSK (G3RUH) format.
  </p>
  <p>
    The comparison of two signals enables extrac­tion of TEC information along
    the signal path, in addition (by measuring the 437MHz signal in both
    polarisations) direct measurement of the degree of Faraday Rotation
    encountered along the same path.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Low Cost Ground Station</h3>

  <p>
    Radio amateurs and satellite enthusiasts around the world will be able to
    participate in the generation and collection of data reporting the results
    via the web to a central point. To assist the many stations involved, the
    KiwiSAT team have developed a receive system using a pair of commercially
    available low cost USB Digital TV receiver ‘dongles’ able to monitor the
    KiwiSAT signal.
  </p>
  <p>
    These, in conjunction with a laptop computer and a small hand held
    antenna, will provide an inexpensive receiving station with tremendous
    possibilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dedicated individuals and STEM based courses at Colleges and Universities
    at over 1000 sites are already downloading basic telemetry data from other
    satellites in the Amateur Satellite Service using single receivers. The
    addition of a second channel (dongle) plus new custom software to enhance
    their facility will secure a truly global network to support this cutting
    edge Climate Change research.
