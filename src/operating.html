<h2>Operating Information for Users</h2>
<p>
  Amateur radio will be used for all communications with the satellite. This
  includes Control and Data acquisition, Science experiment Control and
  Reporting.
</p>
<p>
  All radio systems will operate in accordance with the requirements of the
  ITU-R Amateur Satellite Service.
</p>
<p>
  Both linear and FM amateur radio transponders will be carried and it is
  intended that these will be available in both modes alternatively with
  uplinks in the 70 &amp; 23 cm amateur satellite bands and downlink in the
  2 metre satellite band.
</p>
<p>
  Several beacons will be carried and all will have basic parameters in
  common code. It is intended that all data including that from the science
  experiment will be in a common code format.
