    We are a group of radio amateurs, students, scientists, and engineers that
    have designed, built, and tested a New Zealand satellite intended for
    low Earth orbit.
    <b>At the AMSAT-ZL Annual General Meeting in June, 2023 the group
    officially decided to dissolve and abandon plans for a luanch
      campaign.</b>

    Documentation for much of the work done over the years has
    been published in the hope it may benefit future satellite
    efforts.  <a href="https://github.com/AMSAT-ZL">Read more...</a>

        <h2>Radio</h2>
        <p>
          KiwiSAT was to have carried an amateur radio linear transponder with inputs on
          430 and 1260 MHz and output and beacon on 145 MHz. It also had
          a camera and digital file transfer capability.

        <h2>Science</h2>
        <p>
          KiwiSAT included two science experiments: an Ionospheric
          Research Project that would have allowed characterization of the ionosphere to
          improve the accuracy of Earth observations related to climate change
          and an Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem to refine the
          state of the art in small satellite control.

        <h2>Engineering</h2>
        <p>
          The design, fabrication, and eventual operation of the satellite
          involves a wide variety of engineering disciplines from battery
          technology to space frame construction to ground station capability.

  <p class="mt-16">AMSAT-ZL is indebted to the various NZART Branches, the many individual
     ZL amateurs, and the amateur radio community around the world, who have
     contributed magnanimously to help finance this pioneering project.

    <h3>Clarification</h3>
    <p>KiwiSAT is an orbiting satellite project by radio amateurs under a
       strict "not-for-profit" regime and should not be confused with
       KiwiSat, a commercial ground based animal tracking transmitter.
       As prime owners of the name KiwiSAT, AMSAT-ZL permit its use in
       the lower case format (KiwiSat 101) by
       <a href="https://www.lotek.com/">Lotek</a> for their earth
       bound animal tracking transmitter unit.</p>
