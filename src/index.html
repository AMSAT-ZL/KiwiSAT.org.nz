  <h1>KiwiSAT</h1>
  <h2>A New Zealand Satellite</h2>
  <p class="mt-8">
    We are a group of radio amateurs, students, scientists, and engineers that
    have designed, built, and tested a New Zealand satellite. We are now
    actively pursing launch opportunities for a low earth orbit.

        <h2>Radio</h2>
        <p>
          KiwiSAT carries an amateur radio linear transponder with inputs on
          430 and 1260 MHz and output and beacon on 145 MHz. It also includes
          a camera and digital file transfer capability.

        <h2>Science</h2>
        <p>
          KiwiSAT includes two exciting science experiments: an Ionospheric
          Research Project that allows characterization of the ionosphere to
          improve the accuracy of Earth observations related to climate change
          and an Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem to refine the
          state of the art in small satellite control.

        <h2>Engineering</h2>
        <p>
          The design, fabrication, and eventual operation of the satellite
          involves a wide variety of engineering disciplines from battery
          technology to space frame construction to ground station capability.
