<h2>3-Axis Magnetometer</h2>
<p>
  To measure the magnetic field at any instance, a Honeywell HMR2300 3-axis
  magnetometer will be flown. This has a range of +/- 2 Gauss and a
  resolution of &lt;70 mGauss. A heading resolution of 0.1° is claimed.
</p>
<p>
  The data from this, used in conjunction with British and US Geological
  Survey data, is expected to provide good attitude data (5 ° and 10 °
  Lat./Lon resolutions are available using the IGRF field model). Attitude
  changes using the magnetorque coils will be clearly displayed by this
  unit. There are currently no plans to fly permanent magnetic material in
  the satellite but it may be prudent to incorporate some anti-spin high
  permeability rods if it is decided to use a painted strip (Radiometer) to
  induce passive thermal stability spin after the science package
  experiments are completed. That should not affect the magnetometer once it
  is calibrated. An internal calibration system is included in the sensor
  electronics.
</p>
<p>
  Readings will need to be time tagged and stored for download on ground
  command.
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    [Timing of Magnetometer readings must be controlled to take place
    between magnetorque pulses; an interlock system will be required in the
    software. This is not seen as a particular complication.]
